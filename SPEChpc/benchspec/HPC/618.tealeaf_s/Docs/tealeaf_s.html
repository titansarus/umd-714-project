<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>
TeaLeaf is a mini-app that solves the linear heat conduction equation 
on a spatially decomposed regular grid using a 5 point stencil with 
implicit solvers. TeaLeaf currently solves the equations in two dimensions, 
but three dimensional support is in beta.
</p>

<p>
In TeaLeaf temperatures are stored at the cell centres. A conduction coefficient is 
calculated that is equal to the cell centred density or the reciprocal of the density. 
This is then averaged to each face of the cell for use in the solution. The solve is 
carried out using an implicit method due to the severe timestep limitations imposed 
by the stability criteria of an explicit solution for a parabolic partial differential 
equation. The implicit method requires the solution of a system of linear equations 
which form a regular sparse matrix with a well defined structure.
</p>

<p>
The computation in TeaLeaf has been broken down into "kernels", low level building 
blocks with minimal complexity. Each kernel loops over the entire grid and updates 
the relevant mesh variables. Control logic within each kernel is kept to a minimum, 
allowing maximum optimisation by the compiler. Memory is sacrificed in order to increase 
performance, and any updates to variables that would introduce dependencies between loop 
iterations are written into copies of the mesh.

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>All the input that is required to
generate a TeaLeaf run is contained within the tea.in
input file.</p>

<p> 
The initial time step, simualtion end time and end step are set by 
<code>initial_timestep</code>, <code>end_time</code>, <code>end_step</code> parameters respectively. 
</p>

<p>The follwoing two options set the cell count for each coordinate
 direction. The default is 10 cells in each direction. </p>
<pre> 
x_cells
y_cells
</pre>

<p> The parameters, <code>xmin</code>, <code>xmax</code>, <code>ymin</code> and <code>ymax</code>,
set the size of the computational domain. 
The default domain size is a 10cm square.
</p>

<p> 
The geometric information and initial conditions 
are set using the following keywords with three possible 
variations. Note that state 1 is always the ambient 
material and any geometry information is ignored. 
Areas not covered by other defined states receive the 
energy and density of state 1.
</p>

<pre>
state
density
energy
geometry 
</pre>



<p> The option <code>visit_frequency</code> is the step frequency of visualisations dumps. The files produced are text base VTK files and are easily viewed in an application such as ViSit. The default is to output no graphical data. Note that the overhead of output is high, so should not be invoked when performance benchmarking is being carried out.
</p> 

<p>
The option <code>summary_frequency</code> is the step frequency of summary dumps. This requires a global reduction and associated synchronisation, so performance will be slightly affected as the frequency is increased. The default is for a summary dump to be produced every 10 steps and at the end of the simulation.
</p>



<p>There are a number of other
inputs that can be used for fine control, profiling and visualization. The full
description of these can be found in the links detailed below.</p>

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>The most important output from
TeaLeaf is the field summary print that details the average state variables
of the system, which includes volume, mass, density, energy, temperature.</p>

<p>Timestep information is also output every step.</p>

<p>VTK files can also be outputted
to allow visualization but this is not recommended for benchmarking runs due to
the overhead incurred.</p>
